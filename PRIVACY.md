# Treatment-benefit preview addition (6.0)

The new panel receives only the active calculator’s numeric visit context and
verification flags within the same browser origin. It does not make network
requests, persist its state, accept identifiers, or send fictional predictions
to the calculator/server. Fictional examples remain separate from patient inputs.
Next patient / clear resets both. Existing application privacy limitations below
continue to apply. References below to the former 3D viewer are historical.

# Privacy boundaries · 4.2

The Continuum ZIP is selected inside the browser-only extractor. Original report images and optional numerical surface files are read in that browser. Source pixels and surface arrays can pass between this app's same-origin nested browser frames to support the 3D/report views. They are not included in the Streamlit model calculation message, numeric result downloads or PDF summaries. Original files are not written by the Python calculation code.

The new 3D renderer has no external graphics dependencies. The existing OCR workflow still downloads pinned JSZip, Tesseract.js and language/worker resources from their configured external hosts. The app does not claim a network-isolated or institutionally approved environment simply because image processing runs in a browser.

Scalar input data sent for calculation are processed on the Streamlit server. No name, MRN, date of birth, original filename, exact examination timestamp or report-image bytes should be in that sanitized payload. Review your hosting, logs, authentication, institutional privacy/security requirements and study approval before any use with clinical data. Do not put patient files in GitHub.

Source changes revoke results/geometry matching. Next patient clears model cases, report references, viewer textures, numerical surfaces and displayed image buffers. Asynchronous old image loads cannot repopulate a cleared viewer. This is application cleanup, not a guarantee of secure forensic deletion from browser or operating-system memory.

Distributed screenshots and demo data are explicitly synthetic. No original patient report images, identifiers or numerical patient surfaces are distributed with the package.


## Import repair (4.4)
ZIP nesting, content-signature checks, PDF/TIFF rendering and restricted DICOM report decoding run in the browser. No archive entries, report pixels, full DICOM attributes or exact scan dates are added to the server/model request. Only the existing verified scalar payload goes to inference. DICOM parsing reads only the image/document attributes needed for display; full file bytes remain local memory.

The file-type diagnostic is restricted to static format names, counts and error codes. It excludes user filenames, patient identifiers, timestamps and measurements. Source previews still display whatever is printed on the original reports; these are not anonymized screenshots. Do not share source previews publicly. Decoder/CDN access and the hosting environment require institutional review.

JSZip is local. Optional PDF.js and TIFF/pako assets come from pinned CDN paths. Blocked decoder code produces an explicit error, not a silent server-upload fallback. Reload/reset clears UI references and invalidates pending work; memory cleanup is not a claim of cryptographic erasure.

Version 5.0 also derives estimated numerical maps and approximate shape arrays locally in the browser. These arrays never enter the calculation request, prediction models, PDF summaries or numeric result download. Calibration assets contain generic printed legends/zoom labels only; no patient reports or identifiers are distributed.
